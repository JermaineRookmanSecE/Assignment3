I created a quiz around a couple of random things that I currently am interested in for this assignment as I thought it would help the coding experience to talk about some interests.
I made the program start with first authenticating the user by asking them for a password which is conveniently named to the course, the authentication system on success will then call the question function
which will begin the users quiz. I used switch statements to allow the user to go through every single question and made the answers correlate to the index numbers tied to each of the different choices you have.
I made a function to check if the answer is right and add to your score while also calling CSS to turn each option button a color to show you what was incorrect and what was correct.
at the end of the quiz the results are displayed for the user to see with the amount that they got correct out of the 4 questions they did.
